# Input file for GB calculation

# general selections: give unique name to system; I set mine as "prot-prot", starting and ending frames set to analyze last 500 ns 
#                     of traj (frame 1000-2000 of 0.5ns step trajectories), temprature set at 310.15, to use forcefields for calculation involving only protein set  as "leaprc.protein.ff14SB".
#                     Refer to https://valdes-tresanco-ms.github.io/gmx_MMPBSA/dev/input_file/#parameter-options for more ff options.

#                     Interaction entropy (IE) approximated based on doi 10.1021/jacs.6b02682. Instructed program to run IE (interaction_entropy=1), and calculate
#                     average using last 25% of analyzed trajectory (ie_segment=25).


# gb selections: use modified GB model by A. Onufriev, D. Bashford and D.A. Case (GB-OBC2) by setting igb = 5 and PBRadii=3
#                salt concentration (saltcon) set at 0.15M

 
# FINAL NOTE: the "&general" section must always be included. The other section can differ based on type of calculation desired; choose from 
#             the list featured in https://valdes-tresanco-ms.github.io/gmx_MMPBSA/dev/input_file/#namelists.
