**Description:** This repository contains files used to perform analysis of dynamics and interactions involved in the formation of p7 dimers in the presence of a lipid membrane; this viral protein from Hepatitic C is known to interfer with lipid metabolism & storage. 
Analysis output produces raw time series to be further processed for statistical analysis and comparative plots. These files may be used as templates, please read the comments carefuly and edit according to your system(s) needs.
