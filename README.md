**Description:** This repository contains files used to perform analysis of dynamics and interactions involved in the formation of hepatitis C dimers in the presence of a lipid membrane. 

Most of the resulting files are raw data files, which can then be used for statistical analysis and to make plots for reporting. A few have statistical analysis/plotting already factored into the scripts. Please consider these files as templates - first read through to understand what each command does, then edit to fit your individual needs.

**Resulting publication:**  Campbell, O., Dahhan, D., & Monje, V. (2025). Role of Lipids in Mediating Protein-Protein Interactions during Dimer Assembly. In preparation.
